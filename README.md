- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sutanu
- 👀 I’m interested in Software architecture, development and building solutions for real world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript and react.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything remotely connected to solving a real problem.
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin and Twitter.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can't imagine a life where I am not solving problems.
